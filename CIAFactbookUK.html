<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>
Background
<div>
</h3>
<p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was created when the Kingdoms of England and Scotland -- 
which previously had been distinct states under a single monarchy -- were joined under the 1707 Acts of Union. 
The island of Ireland was incorporated under the 1800 Acts of Union, 
while Wales had been part of the Kingdom of England since the 16th century. 
The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. 
The 18th and 19th centuries saw the rapid expansion of the British Empire despite the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, and at its zenith in the early 20th century, 
the British Empire stretched over one fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw two World Wars seriously deplete the UK's strength and the Irish Republic withdraw from the union. 
The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth of Nations, the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. 
The devolved Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1998.
